I'm a huge fan of writing and of stories in general, and although I strongly believe a game should focus on having good mechanics before having a good story, the interactive element of such a media makes it so that a story can only enrich a game if done well.

So this is where I'll work on just that: the story of the game. I'll try and come up with a pitch and maybe even a short synopsis for when the first draft of the game will be ready. That way, we will be able to work on it with a clear idea of how the game will keep the players attention in and not on the game.

Let it be very clear that I do not intend to write something long or complicated. It should become a tool for the game to further intrigue the player, and not the main focus of the game, even less so the "main selling part".

Of course, if this file exist for you to read, it is to get feed back and to hear your opinions of the pitches/synopsis.

Story wise, looking at the main element of the game (the lag/stopped time mechanic), it is going to be a challenge to find a good story surrounding that. But we'll figure something out, I'm sure.

That's all for now. As soon as something worth while comes to mind, I'll upload it here, so keep an eye on this if you will.
