This will be where we will discuss the visual themes of the game in general. I insist on WE: everyone is invited to give their opinion or ideas.

I think it's pretty clear knowing we're aiming for this to be a game for the arcade of the HackerSpace that we wan't something with a retro aesthetic. This is already achieved with the fact that we're going for pixel art, but if anyother ideas surrounding that theme comes your way, share!

As for the genre, I proposed sci-fi, especially since the idea of time stopping/lagging would make more sense to me in such a genre than any other. It could also work in fantasy I suppose. What do you guys think? What genre should we go for?

I'm a huge fan of dark, sinister, horror and loneliness so I would be bias to go for that kind of "feel" for the game. Crashed spaceships, filled only with dead bodies and scrap metal, for example. Again, we need to talk about what we actually want for the game.
