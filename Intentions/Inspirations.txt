These are the different games/movies/books that could help us find new ideas for the game design, the look, the feel, the sound ect.

If you haven't played Transistor yet, you don't know what having fun means yet. I won't spoil it, but it has a mechanic very similar to ours in a way that the main character is able to stop time to plan her actions. It's hard to describe more than that without going into the details so I strongly suggest you go and check it out.

Of course any 2d fighting game could be a great example for a source of inspiration gaming wise, but super smash bros is one that instinctively comes to mind!
