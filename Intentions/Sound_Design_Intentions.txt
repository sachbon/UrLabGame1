Same as for the visual design. We need to have an idea on what kind of feel/aesthetic/genre we want for this game.

I'm going to put here a few links to songs I feel would be awesome as inspiration for a soundtrack. It's both great to put every one on the same page "feeling wise", like Pastafari said, and also a great way to see what kind of taste everybody has. We should focus on making a game we all like, so it's important we all agree on the intentions for the game. This is why I invite you to do the same:

Olfg:
The first one is Old Friends, from the Transistor Game of Supergiant Games. I'm putting the main theme but any of those songs we do, especially since inside the game, the songs have 2 themes: one normal and one when the time is stopped by the main character(much like in this game). It could be something really interesting to implement ourselves.

Since this is a playlist, I would recommend you listened to Old Friends, but also Forecast, In Circles, Traces, Apex Beat and Impossible. When it comes to supergiant games, you can always count on them to deliver a great soundtrack so check there other games too if you have the time.

The next up is ALl for one's theme from My Hero Academia. (I know, I'm a weeb, shoot me.) I talked about the fact that I like dark, sinister, lonely and the horrifying. Well, I think that pretty much somes it up! Eeriness is my favourite kind of horror.

The two next one are two game soundtracks which both emulate an old school theme but in different ways.
this one is from hyper light drifter, a game which doesn't mind upgrading visually the retro genre and does the exact same thing with its soundtrack.

This next one is from mother russia bleeds, that sticks more closely to the original way of doing things back in the old days without ever actually respecting the 8 or even 16 bit technology restrictions that would have been at the time.

I think they are pretty self explanatory if you listen to them: a very similar retro feel (although mother russia bleeds is much more agressive), but with two completely different styles/methods.

That's all for now. I don't think it's necessary to give more than that, especially since I'm already focusing too much on sci-fi when we haven't even decided what we would collectively rather do!
